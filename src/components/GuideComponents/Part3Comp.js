      <h2>Vocal</h2>
      <h3>Part 1 - lead singer</h3>
      <h4>
        There is always a lead singer assigned to lead a song. The lead singer
        would usually start the song with exhortation and solo verse. It is
        crucial that the lead singer’s voice is loud enough to hear over all
        other sounds. The lead singer’s volume should be significantly louder
        than other vocals most of the time.
      </h4>
      <h3>Part 2 - Background Vocal (Unison)</h3>
      <h4>
        In the progression of each song, there are parts called “Unison”. it’s
        where all the singers come in and sing the melody of the song. Typically
        go for the second verse or the first chorus of the song. wherever it
        might be, on this part of “unison”, make sure to have all the vocals
        loud enough so the background vocals add and support the lead vocal.
      </h4>
      <h3>Part 3 - Harmony</h3>
      <h4>
        When background vocals sing harmony, make sure each singer is loud
        enough to be heard but not to overpower the lead vocal. Remember, the
        point is to be harmonized, not to be stood out.
      </h4>
      <h3>Part 4 - Exhortation</h3>
      <h4>
        Everytime when either lead vocals or the person doing the offering
        message is speaking while band is playing, they must be significantly
        louder than all other sounds going on. Congregation must be able to hear
        what the person is speaking.
      </h4>
      <h2>Band</h2>
      <h3>Part 1 - STEM </h3>
      <h4>
        Stems are stereo recordings sourced from mixes of multiple individual
        tracks, such as drums, vocals, and bass. We use STEM to add more sound
        to our worship. We have STEM guitar, Steam Keys,Stem Bass ,and Loop.
        Audio engineers must know what STEM channels make what sound and add the
        right amount of volume to it so it’s not overwhelming. You may raise a
        certain STEM channel up but it shouldn’t be too powerful.
      </h4>
      <h3>Part 2 - Band</h3>
      <h4>
        It’s not possible to define a good mix because it’s different by the
        type of the song or style of the song. Sometimes during intro, interlude
        or the ending, some instruments need to be stood out but other than
        that, make sure all the instruments can be heard. Not one or the other
        instrument overpower others.
